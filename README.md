# Operating Systems (CS330A) Assignments

This repository contains all of my assignment solutions for the Operating Systems course at IIT Kanpur for the odd semester of 2018-19.
This course was done under [Prof. Debadatta Mishra](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/deba/).
The course webpage is hosted [here](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/deba/cs330/) (as of 2018-12-08).

The first 3 assignments consist of development on an OS made using the [gem5](http://gem5.org/Main_Page) architectural simulator.
This OS will be referred to as gemOS.
Instructions for setting up gemOS is given in this [pdf](./gemos-howto.pdf).

## Table of Contents
* [Assignment 1](./gemOS-a1): Virtual memory and paging for gemOS.
* [Assignment 2](./gemOS-a2): System call implementations for gemOS.
